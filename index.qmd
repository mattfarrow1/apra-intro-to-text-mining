## Workshop Link

Workshop attendees may click [this link](https://posit.cloud/spaces/402448/join?access_code=fwlAcK_yXIxTkegUsEBSHHINTmR8PtC2tQX8oIly "Text Mining Workshop Link") to join today's Posit Cloud work space. **Computing resources have been allocated only for workshop attendees.**

## GitHub Links

This website has been built from a GitHub repository located at <https://github.com/mattfarrow1/apra-intro-to-text-mining>. It contains everything used in the workshop including slides, data, scripts, and resources.

There is a second repository located at <https://github.com/mattfarrow1/text-mining-workshop> that contains only the data and scripts for the workshop. This is the repository that the Posit Cloud work space connects to.

# Overview

Free text, or unstructured data, is found throughout our CRMs in places like contact reports, notes, research profiles, emails, and more. In this workshop, we'll look at ways to get started with text mining in order to begin answering questions, surfacing insights, understanding sentiment, and bringing more value to your work. The workshop will be split into sections on Excel, R, and Python and will allow attendees the opportunity to work through examples and takeaway ideas for implementing these concepts at their own organizations.

## Competencies

|               |                                                                       |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

| **Auxiliary** | DS: Competency 5: Visualization/Reporting Techniques and Competencies |
| **Tertiary**  | DS: Competency 4: Statistical Techniques and Competencies             |

## Learning Objectives

|                          |                                                                                                                                                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Objective 1** | Attendees will create word counts and keyword searches in Excel.                                                                                               |
| **Learning Objective 2** | Attendees will also utilize R (possibly Python too) to work on advanced text mining including stop words, topic modeling, word clouds, and sentiment analysis. |

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop at Apra PD 2023, but should be useful for self-guided learning as well.
