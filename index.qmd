# Pre-Work

## Using Posit Cloud

The materials for this workshop are available in a cloud environment that can be run with no downloads or setup. If you plan to go this route, there is nothing else you need to do in preparation, simply scan the QR code or visit <https://posit.cloud/content/6215314>.

## Using a Local Installation

If you are a workshop attendee and have any trouble with installation locally, please reach out to me directly!

-   Install latest version of RStudio, [`2023.06.0+421)` or later](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
-   Ideally upgrade/use to R 4.3.1 (I'm using the native pipe `|>`)
-   Install these R packages:

```{r pkg-list}
#| eval: false
pkg_list <- c(
  "tidyverse", "tidytext", "wordcloud"
  )
install.packages(pkg_list)
```

::: callout-tip
If you are a workshop attendee who would like to use their own RStudio installation, please clone <https://github.com/mattfarrow1/text-mining-workshop.git> via RStudio on Monday morning (August 28).

## (Optional!) Pre-Work for Python

This will be a R/RStudio-centric course based on the attendees, but we will briefly cover using Python for text mining. This code can be run in Posit Cloud, but if you are interested in installing it on your machine, here are some helpful links:

-   Install Python, following instructions at [Minimum Viable Python](https://solutions.rstudio.com/python/minimum-viable-python/installing-python/)
-   Install [Jupyter](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/python.html#installation)
-   Install VSCode, [Quarto VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto), [Python VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python), [Jupyter VSCode extension](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-toolsai/jupyter)

# Overview

Free text, or unstructured data, is found throughout our CRMs in places like contact reports, notes, research profiles, emails, and more. In this workshop, we'll look at ways to get started with text mining in order to begin answering questions, surfacing insights, understanding sentiment, and bringing more value to your work. The workshop will be split into sections on Excel, R, and Python and will allow attendees the opportunity to work through examples and takeaway ideas for implementing these concepts at their own organizations.

## Competencies

|               |                                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary**   | DS: Competency 3: Data Manipulation Skills                            |
| **Auxiliary** | DS: Competency 5: Visualization/Reporting Techniques and Competencies |
| **Tertiary**  | DS: Competency 4: Statistical Techniques and Competencies             |

## Learning Objectives

|                          |                                                                                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Learning Objective 1** | Attendees will create word counts and keyword searches in Excel.                                                                                               |
| **Learning Objective 2** | Attendees will also utilize R (possibly Python too) to work on advanced text mining including stop words, topic modeling, word clouds, and sentiment analysis. |

> These materials are developed for a trainer-led workshop at Apra PD 2023, but should be useful for self-guided learning as well.
