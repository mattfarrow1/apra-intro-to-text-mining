## Excel Agenda

-   Why Excel?
-   Word Counts
-   References & VLOOKUP
-   Keyword Search
-   ChatGPT

## Why Choose Excel?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Pros**

-   Universally available
-   Not going anywhere
-   Low barrier to entry
-   Scales in complexity
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Cons**

-   Can be difficult to reproduce
-   Potentially destructive
-   Doesn't scale well
-   Complex formulas can be difficult

## Word Counts {.smaller}

`=LEN(TRIM(A1))-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))+1`

-   `LEN(A1)` counts the total number of characters in `A1`
-   `TRIM` removes any leading, trailing, and extra spaces (except single spaces between words)
-   `SUBSTITUTE(A1,” “,””)` removes all spaces from the text
-   `LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,” “,“”)` -- counts the total number of characters in the text that have no spaces
-   `LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,” “,“”))` subtracts the text length without spaces from the text length with spaces
-   `=LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1,” “,“”))+1` add 1 to the result as the number of spaces is one less than the total number of words

## VLOOKUP {.smaller}

`=VLOOKUP(A1, '[WorkbookName.xlsx]SheetName'!A1:B10,2,FALSE)`

-   `A1` the value you are looking up
-   `'[WorkbookName.xlsx]SheetName'!A1:B10` the range where you are looking for a match
-   `2` the column the match is found in
-   `FALSE` indicates whether you want to match exactly (FALSE) or approximately (TRUE)

## Absolute/Relative References {.smaller}

-   Relative references **can** move.
-   Absolute references **can't** move.

```{r}

```

|   Reference    | Result When Copied                    |
|:--------------:|---------------------------------------|
|       A2       | The row and column both change        |
|    **\$**A2    | The column does not change            |
|    A**\$**2    | The row does not change               |
| **\$**A**\$**2 | Neither the row nor the column change |

## Keyword Searches {.smaller}

`=IF(SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(keyword,A2)))>0,"Yes","No")`

-   `keyword` is a named range of the words you are searching for
-   `A2` is the cell in the column you're searching in
-   `SEARCH(keyword,A2)` returns the start number of the found string as a number
-   `ISNUMBER(SEARCH(keyword,A2))` converts items to either TRUE or FALSE
-   `--ISNUMBER(SEARCH(keyword,A2))` coerces the TRUE and FALSE values to 1 and 0
-   `SUMPRODUCT` sums the 1's and 0's
-   `IF(SUMPRODUCT...)>0,"Yes","No")` if the result of `SUMPRODUCT` is greater than 1, then the formula returns "Yes" (or any other result you want)
