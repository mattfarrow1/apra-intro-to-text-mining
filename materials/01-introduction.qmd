```

## Poll

1.  What do you think of when I say text mining?
2.  How much experience do you have with coding languages like R or Python?
3.  What types of things are you most interested in? (keywords, sentiment, ngrams, word clouds...)

## What is text mining?

Text mining is the process of extracting information and insights from unstructured text.

## Terms to Know

-   **Natural Language**: A natural language, as opposed to an artificially created language such as R or Python, develops gradually and often without thought, over time. (*Examples include English or Italian.*)
-   **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: refers to the creation and use of computational power in order to process content in natural language.

## Terms to Know

-   **Segmentation/Tokenization**: the process of splitting apart pieces of language. *Sentence segmentation* is the process of breaking sentences apart using tokenizers to examine punctuation, abbreviations, and capitalization. *Word tokenization* involves breaking out the individual words of a sentence.

## Terms to Know

-   **Text Normalization**: involves standardizing text prior to analysis. Examples include the expansion of contractions (don't -\> do not), removal of stop words (of, and, it), correcting misspellings, and stemming (if required)

## Terms to Know

-   **Term Frequency**: measures how often a term appears in a document.
-   **Document Frequency**: measures how often a term appears in a corpus of documents.

## Terms to Know

-   **Inverse Document Frequency**: a number computed by dividing the total number of documents in the corpus by the number of documents containing the target term and applying a log scale.
-   **TF-IDF**: "Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency". Higher term frequency and a lower document frequency leads to a higher TF-IDF.

## Levels of Analysis

-   **Lexical Analysis**: The most basic form of NLP, lexical analysis is focused on analyzing individual words.
-   **Syntactic Analysis**: concerned with processing the grammar of written words.
-   **Semantic Analysis**: builds on lexical and syntactic analyses in order to understand the meanings of words.
-   **Discourse Analysis**: Understanding inferences in language is the domain of discourse analysis.
