# Terms to Know

## Text Mining

**Text mining** is the process of extracting information and insights from unstructured text.

## Natural Language

> A natural language, as opposed to an artificially created language such as R or Python, develops gradually and often without thought, over time. (*Examples include English or Italian.*)

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

The process of understanding what text is saying, and being able to analyze it grammatically, is what is referred to as **natural language processing (NLP)**.

> ## refers to the creation and use of computational power in order to process content in natural language.

## Segmentation/Tokenization

> the process of splitting apart pieces of language. 

-   *Sentence segmentation* is the process of breaking sentences apart using tokenizers to examine punctuation, abbreviations, and capitalization.
-   *Word tokenization* involves breaking out the individual words of a sentence.

## Stop Words

> Filler words that don't convey a lot of information (pronouns, articles, etc.)

*the, and, of, a, he, she, for, to, that*

## Normalization

> involves standardizing text prior to analysis. Examples include the expansion of contractions (don't -\> do not), removal of stop words (of, and, it), correcting misspellings, and stemming (if required)

## Stems/Stemming

- **Stems**: the morpheme that supplies the main meaning of a word (*jump* in *jumping*)
- **Stemming**: a tool that takes a word and returns the stem (*running* -> *run*)

## Term Frequency

> Measures how often a term appears in a document.

## Document Frequency

> Measures how often a term appears in a corpus of documents.

## Corpus

## Inverse Document Frequency

> a number computed by dividing the total number of documents in the corpus by the number of documents containing the target term and applying a log scale.

## Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)

> Higher term frequency and a lower document frequency leads to a higher TF-IDF.

## _____ Similarity

-   **Word Similarity**: similarity between individual words or tokens
-   **Document Similarity**: similarity between short phrases or documents
-   **Jaccard Similarity**: similarity and diversity of a sample data set by looking at how many terms the two documents share, compared to the total vocabulary

-   **Cosine Similarity**: similarity between words

-   **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**: an algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of the vector space in order to understand which words are most associated (i.e. king:male, queen:female, doctor:male, nurse:female)

## Levels of Analysis

-   **Lexical Analysis**: The most basic form of NLP, lexical analysis is focused on analyzing individual words.
-   **Syntactic Analysis**: concerned with processing the grammar of written words.
-   **Semantic Analysis**: builds on lexical and syntactic analyses in order to understand the meanings of words.
-   **Discourse Analysis**: Understanding inferences in language is the domain of discourse analysis.
