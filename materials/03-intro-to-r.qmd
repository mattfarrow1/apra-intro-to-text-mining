# R {background-image="/materials/slide templates/Slide3.png" background-size="contain"}

## Getting Started

1.  What is R?
2.  R vs. Python?

::: notes
R is a programming language started by professors Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman as a programming language to teach introductory statistics at the University of Auckland. It was developed in the early 1990's and open sourced in 1995.

For the purposes of this workshop, there are no significant differences in R vs. Python other than the language and packages/libraries used. I chose to start with R because that's where I'm most comfortable, it's the language that I see Apra promoting, and the community is incredibly welcoming and diverse.
