# Extracting Value from Free Text

### An Introduction to Text Mining

A presentation for [Apra PD 2023](https://www.aprahome.org/Events/Prospect-Development-2023) by Matt Farrow

Free text, or unstructured data, is found throughout our CRMs in places like contact reports, notes, research profiles, emails, and more. In this workshop, we'll look at ways to get started with text mining in order to begin answering questions, surfacing insights, understanding sentiment, and bringing more value to your work. The workshop will be split into sections on Excel, R, and Python and will allow attendees the opportunity to work through examples and takeaway ideas for implementing these concepts at their own organizations.
